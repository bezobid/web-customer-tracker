# web-customer-tracker
This is a very basic CRM web-app with Spring MVC, Hibernate and MySQL under the hood. At this point you can:
- add new customer to the database
- edit an existing cutomer
- delete customer
- search customers by first/last name

Database connection properties are hardcoded, you can find them in myDataSource bean section of src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring-mvc-crud-demo-servlet.xml.
